### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
Intro to Web design. One semester course
- html -- headings, paragraphs, list
- Css -- front, color, images, link (websites)
- Final project create a website

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)
- unit for students currently in an CSP course for after the exam.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

Impacts of Computing
9-12.IC.4 Assess personal and societal trade-offs related to computing technologies and data privacy. 
9-12.IC.5 Describe ways that complex computer systems can be designed for inclusivity and to mitigate unintended consequences. 
9-12.IC.6 Create accessible computational artifacts that meet standard compliance requirements or otherwise meet the needs of users with disabilities.
9-12.IC.7 Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields. 

Computational Thinking
9-12.CT.3 Refine and visualize complex data sets to tell different stories with the same data set. 

9-12.CT.2 Collect and evaluate data from multiple sources for use in a computational artifact.

Algorithms and Programming
9-12.CT.8 Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

9-12.CT.9 Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

9-12.CT.10 Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.

Digital Literacy 

9-12.DL.2 Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.
